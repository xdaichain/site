# Moving xDai to Dai

1\) Go to [https://dai-bridge.poa.network](https://dai-bridge.poa.network). [Connect your web3 wallet](../wallets-setup/metamask-setup.md) \(MetaMask, Nifty Wallet\) to the **xDai Chain**. Once connected, you will see your address populated in the header, and your xDai and Dai balance displayed on the page. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a small additional amount of xDai to process the transaction \(less than .0001!\)
{% endhint %}

3\) A confirmation window will appear. Click **Continue.**

5\) Wait for the transaction to process. Transaction will be confirmed in 5 seconds, but the relay confirmation takes additional time \(depending on the number of chain validators and the mainnet network throughput\).
