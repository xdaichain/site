# MyCrypto

**Wallet Type**: [Browser/Application Based](https://app.mycrypto.com/)

**Description**: With [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/) you can create a new wallet using their desktop application, or use an existing address with a web3 wallet like MetaMask to connect to the MyCrypto application. You can then connect to both Ethereum and xDai simultaneously, allowing you to see and interact with assets across networks. Features include the ability to send, swap, request and buy crypto assets.

## Connecting your xDai account to MyCrypto <a id="97c9"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The following instructions come from a [MyCrypto Blog Post](https://medium.com/mycrypto/how-to-get-xdai-and-connect-to-mycrypto-f9691a42e51e).
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Go to [https://app.mycrypto.com/add-account/](https://app.mycrypto.com/add-account/)

**Step 2**: Select the wallet you’ll be connecting to MyCrypto. _Note: click “View Address” if you only plan to track an account and not send from it._

**Step 3**: Select the xDai network from the dropdown. _Note: If using MetaMask, you will not see this dropdown, rather select the xDai network within MetaMask before continuing._

**Step 4**: Continue to connect, and check out your xDai account\(s\) on your MyCrypto dashboard, right alongside any other accounts you have!

_Y_ou can use the same account for Ethereum and for xDai, so we’ve made sure to distinguish your accounts separately according to the network they’re attached to. Note the above screenshot where it shows two separate listings for one address — one used with Ethereum, one used with xDai.

### You’re all done! <a id="a317"></a>

From here, you can view your balances and interact with MyCrypto features using your xDai account just like you would with an Ethereum account.

_If you have a token that you aren’t seeing properly on your MyCrypto dashboard, please let us know so we can_ [_add it to our default list_](https://medium.com/mycrypto/how-to-add-a-custom-token-to-mycrypto-a51a18ea3f74)_._
