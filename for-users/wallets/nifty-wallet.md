# Nifty Wallet

**Wallet Type**: Web3 wallet: [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid?hl=en)

**Description**:  Nifty Wallet is an open-source wallet tha provides a seamless web3 wallet experience. Sites designed to work with MetaMask will also work with Nifty, and Nifty provides additional features such as out-of-the-box support for xDai and other chains, as well as the ability to interact with contract methods directly from the wallet interface.

Nifty Wallet is our preferred web3 wallet and is used to support many of our xDai tutorials. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Nifty Wallet and MetaMask do not function properly when both are activated at the same time as chrome extensions. To use one or the other, **right click** on the extension icon, go to **Manage Extensions**, and **toggle off/on** the application you want to use. All data will be preserved in the wallet for future access.  
{% endhint %}
