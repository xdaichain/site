# Receive & Send

Sending & Receiving is intuitive, and is based around QR codes for mobile. You can also copy/paste addresses for other formats. Primary usage is for sending and receiving xDai, however you can also send/receive ETH and DAI through the Burner Wallet.

## Receive \(xDai or ETH/Dai\)

1\) Click the Receive button.

2\) The Sender can scan the QR, or you can copy the address and send manually.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the wallet address is functional on both the Ethereum Mainnet and the xDai chain. So someone can send Ether or Dai to this address, as well as xDai. All amounts will show up in the wallet interface.
{% endhint %}

Here we received some xDai and ETH \(in 2 separate transactions, one sent from the xDai chain and one from the ETH mainnet\)

3\) Click View on BlockScout to see transfers for this wallet address. Transactions will appear below, including any chat transactions \(that's right, besides sending tx you can also send and receive messages!\)

You can also switch to the Ethereum mainnet to check your address on the mainnet, if you've transferred any Eth or Dai.
