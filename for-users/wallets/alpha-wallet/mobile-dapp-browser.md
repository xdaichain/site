# Mobile DApp Browser

Alpha offers a mobile browser for xDai-centric applications. xDai is on the browser homepage in the Android wallet \(not yet available on iOS\), with links to popular applications built on xDai.  Simply go to the browser icon, then click on the xDai section to view and visit xDai applications.

Alpha also includes easy links for interaction with the DApps you use most, like HoneySwap and Ramp for fiat purchases.
