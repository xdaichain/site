# Buying xDai with Portis via Carbon

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your billing address is located in the U.S., Wyre is used to purchase xDai via the Portis wallet. If outside the US, you will use [Carbon](../buying-xdai-with-wyre/buying-xdai-with-portis.md) to buy xDai in the Portis wallet.

With Carbon, up to $250 in xDai may be purchased per day without KYC verification. 
{% endhint %}



1\) Go to [portis.io](https://www.portis.io/) and click the **Get Started** button to create a new wallet \(or login to an existing wallet if you have one\).

2\) You will see xDai in the tokens list. Click on the **Buy** icon in the bottom menu. If you have not verified your email, you will be prompted to verify.

Also, it will generate one-time use cards that can protect your main card from possible leaks. Here is the reference [link](https://privacy.com/join/ME94Y) .
