# Getting Started with xDai

## 1\) Set your Chain ID and RPC

To get started on xDai, you will need to setup your externally owned address \(wallet address\) to access the xDai chain. You can use the same address you use on Ethereum, but the chain id and RPC must point to xDai.  

* You can use [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to quickly add to MetaMask, or
* See the [MetaMask Setup tutorial](wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) for example steps and configuration.
* If desired, you can also use a [different RPC endpoint](../for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints) or even [setup your own node to connect](../for-developers/install-xdai-client/) with.
* See the [wallets section](wallets/) for additional wallets that support xDai out of the box and don't require configuration.

{% endhint %}

## 2\) Get a Little xDai

## 3\) BlockScout is your Home Base

## 4\) Bridges Connecting Ecosystems

You can move tokens between xDai and Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon \(xDai token only\) with the various available bridges. See the bridges section for more details on each bridge.  If you move a token to xDai, be sure to add the custom token to your wallet. Clicking the fox icon in BlockScout or the Omnibridge will quickly add the token.
