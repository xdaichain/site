# View Inbound \(Dai to xDai\) Transactions

When Dai is transferred from Ethereum to xDai on the xDai chain, the amount of Dai in your wallet will decrease and the corresponding amount of xDai will increase. However, the transaction will not appear on the xDai side of the wallet.  The easiest way to track it is in BlockScout with the Coin Balance History view.

1\) Copy the account address used for the transaction.

![Copy Address - you can be connected to Ethereum or xDai, it is the same address on both chains.](../../../.gitbook/assets/tut22.jpg)

2\) Paste the address into BlockScout at [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/).

Red txs signify outgoing and green are incoming. You can click on the block number to find your transaction in the block if you'd like more information.
