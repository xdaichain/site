# Send xDai with a Loaded Link

One convenient 🔥Burner Wallet \(BW\) feature is the ability to create a clickable link that contains xDai. The link opens up for the receiver directly in a new or existing BW, and contains the amount sent.

To receive a loaded link, simply click the link**.** If you already have a BW or keys saved to local storage, your existing wallet will open and claim the amount.

If you don't have a wallet, or are on a different device/browser, or have never heard of crypto🙂, the link will open with a browser window with a new Burner Wallet and populated with the amount of xDai contained in the link! 

## Create a Loaded Link

1\) Click the **Link** button

2\) Enter the amount of xDai to embed in the link and click **Send**.

3\) The loaded link will take a moment to create. When done, you can share it with a QR code or **copy the link** and send in any way you'd like \(email, text, telegram etc\). The first person to click the link will claim it automatically, so don't share in a public forum unless you are expecting first come, first served!
