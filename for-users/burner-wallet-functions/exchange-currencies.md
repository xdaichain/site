# Exchange Currencies

{% hint style="warning" %}
 xDai to Dai exchange requires an extra step where tokens must be claimed on Ethereum. The bridge at [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/) is the recommended method for this exchange.

If you have used the Burner Wallet to exchange currencies and have not received, go to the xDai bridge and connect with your burner account to claim your Dai. [More troubleshooting info is available here](../converting-xdai-via-bridge/troubleshooting.md).
{% endhint %}

You can transfer currencies directly within the wallet interface - from ETH -&gt; DAI and DAI -&gt; xDai, or in the reverse direction from xDai -&gt; DAI and DAI -&gt; ETH.  This all-in-one interface makes it easy to initiate and complete transfers.

To start, Click **Exchange.**

## Exchange ETH -&gt; DAI -&gt; xDai

You can use the burner wallet interface to transform your Eth into xDai, without needing to go through an exchange or use the Bridge UI. You will need some extra Eth to pay gas fees for the transfers.

1\) Press the **Eth to Dai** button.

2\) Enter the amount in USD to send and click **Send**. The app will automatically calculate the gas fees and transfer through UniSwap. You may end up paying higher than normal gas fees for this operation - conduct manually to control fees.
