## Getting Started

1\) Create an account and login, then add transactions for various chains and exchanges from the import screen. You can begin with a free account, and only pay when generating a tax report.

For xDai, enter xDai into the search field or scroll down and select.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no data available for txs receiving xDai via the xDai Bridge, or other ERC20s via the Omnibridge. These transactions should be entered manually as '**buys**'.
{% endhint %}

4\) When all transactions are properly categorized and any additional transactions added manually, proceed to Generate a Report. Costs to create the report vary based on individual usage and needs.
