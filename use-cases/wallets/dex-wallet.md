**What the team says** : _"We believe that xDai Chain opens up avenues for real use cases that are essential within a local economy. By having a USD stable coin and predictable USD gas costs within a network, we’re able to operate in a high performance state, executing transactions in merely seconds and resulting in a quick and seamless user experience._" _-- \*Alessio Delmonti - Founder of DEX Wallet._
