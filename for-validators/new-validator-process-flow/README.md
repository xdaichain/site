# New Validator Process Flow

New Validator candidates should [follow the process outlined here](../../for-stakers/staking-protocol/become-a-candidate-validator.md). You will need the minimum amount of STAKE as well as a working node configured with your mining address.

You can choose to run either a Nethermind or OpenEthereum client. The [Nethermind](nethermind-node-setup.md) implementation is still considered in Beta, [Open Ethereum ](../../for-developers/install-xdai-client/parity.md)is recommended for first time validators.
