# Original xDai Validators

⚔ xDai chain consensus was originally provided by a dedicated group of organizations who donated their time and resources to protect the chain. Their main incentive was not financial rewards \(they made less than they spent on infrastructure\) but a desire to invent new solutions, participate in on-chain governance, and support complimentary ecosystem tools.

Thanks to these groups, the xDai chain has proven to be resilient and robust since its inception. xDai has provided speed and low-cost, stable transactions for a variety of blockchain projects. This includes transactional capacity for  [conferences of up to 10,000 participants](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/pony-purse-conference-and-event-wallet), [community currencies in Africa](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/use-cases/community-currencies), and [pop-up crypto events](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/decentralized-cypherpunk-speakeasy-2fdbdc446318) throughout the world.  

The organizations who believe in this project and have helped it grow are listed below. With POSDAO, these validators are now serving as the initial PoS validators. The community is thankful and appreciative of these organizations who have helped create, nurture and grow the one-and-only xDai stable chain.
