Public POSDAO staking can be accessed at [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/validators](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/validators)
{% endhint %}

POSDAO introduces a staking token, called STAKE, as well as a new consensus model where individuals who own STAKE may become validators or may delegate their stake on current validators in order to protect the chain. Validators and delegators receive rewards in exchange for providing STAKE.
