## TokenBridge

A bridge is required to move locked Dai from Ethereum and mint xDai on xDai Chain

You can access the bridge via:

* TokenBridge UI at [https://dai-bridge.poa.network](https://dai-bridge.poa.network)
* Interactions with Smart contracts[ ](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui)[https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui)
* Bridge UI built-in into AlphaWallet, BurnerWallet, BurnerFactory

## DApp Management & Developer Tools

* [Biconomy](https://medium.com/biconomy/biconomy-supports-xdai-chain-4d21d1f70222) allows for for gasless transactions and improved DApp UX.
* [Pocket](https://www.pokt.network/) provides a decentralized API layer for DApp developers \(IOS, Android & Web SDKs available\) and blockchain users.
* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com) supports xDai data indexing, querying and display.
* [Chainbeat](https://chainbeat.io/) provides monitoring and analytics tools for DApp developers. 
* [Tenderly ](https://tenderly.co/)dashboard supports xDai transaction inspection - smart contracts can also be pushed to the dashboard for real-time monitoring.
