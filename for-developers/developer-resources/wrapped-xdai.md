# Wrapped xDai \(wxDai\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/wrapeth.png)

Native blockchain coins like xDai can be converted to wrapped ERC20 tokens that live on the same chain. This increases potential use cases for DEX applications, swaps, and DAO interactions.

The wrapeth tool by Raid Guild is a simple conversion tool to wrap xDai &lt;-&gt; wxDai.

1. To start, go to [https://wrapeth.com/](https://wrapeth.com/). Connect your web3wallet to the application, then [connect to the xDai Network](../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md). 
2. From here, enter the amount to wrap or unwrap. To view the wxDai to your wallet tokens list, add the wxDai contract to the custom tokens section of your wallet interface:
