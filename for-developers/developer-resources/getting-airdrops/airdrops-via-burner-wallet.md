# Getting airdrops via Burner Wallet

### BurnerWallet airdrops: 

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that links used in the tutorial are already claimed
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You do not need an existing Burner wallet to claim an airdrop. If you have not used BurnerWallet before, or do not have a stored local address, a new wallet address will be created when you scan the QR code or click the link.

If you do want to claim to an existing BurnerWallet address, **make sure your wallet \(**[at https://xdai.io](https://xdai.io)**\) is connected to that address before claiming the link.**

You can always send from a newly generated address to an existing address later.  
{% endhint %}

### Airdrops will either take the form of a QR code or a link.

A\) **QR code**

1. If you receive a QR code, you can scan from the BurnerWallet application at [https://xdai.io](https://xdai.io%20) or directly with your camera if using an iphone.
