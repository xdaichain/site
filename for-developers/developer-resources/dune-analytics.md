# Dune Analytics

Dune Analytics offers native support for contracts deployed to xDai. Create and share custom dashboards and queries from both Ethereum and xDai. It is possible to mix-and-match between chains on the same dashboard.

## Getting Started

1\) Create a user account at [duneanalytics.com](https://www.duneanalytics.com/).  
2\) Login to access the application.  
3\) Once in the app, you can create a custom query.

1. Switch the data source to xDai.
2. Write your query.
3. Execute the query \(execution can take some time depending on query complexity\).
4. Query results appear once complete. From here you can create visualizations with data on xDai.

5\) You will see the current indexed contracts when changing data sources. If you don't see the contract you want to query, submit it for decoding at [duneanalytics.com/decode](https://www.duneanalytics.com/decode) 📥

{% hint style="info" %}
All other processes are the same. See the [Dune Documentation](https://hackmd.io/k71ZUSTxQVKGqOcvR6OXnw) for example queries, support and other tips for getting the most out of Dune!
