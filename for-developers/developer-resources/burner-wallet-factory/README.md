**Burner Factory:** The Burner Factory is a complimentary application to the Burner Wallet. Burner Factory allows anyone to build a custom "burner experience" without writing a single line of code. The current site allows customizing the set of tokens and exchange pairs included in a wallet, and quickly deploying that wallet to a server.
