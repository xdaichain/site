# Previous Grant Recipients

{% hint style="info" %}
 The xDai grants program was previously broken down into 2 categories. 1 funding category for general adoption and a second for a ZK privacy Initiative. Projects below received funding from these grants. A new grant initiative is now open to fuel the next generation of Dapps and features on xDai. [Apply here](https://airtable.com/shrThZ9013meNu6BX)!

### Previous General Adoption Recipient

**Burner Wallet 2**: The next evolution in the Burner Wallet\(BW\)! We provided a $ 5,000 DAI grant to David Mihal to continue development on this tool, including a plugin that will make fiat -&gt; xDai conversion a simple process, and a second plugin to support sending and receiving xDai through LinkDrop.   

Burner Wallet 2 was used at Devcon 5 and EthWaterloo to power food & beverage purchases, games, and other conference functionality.

### Previous ZK fund recipients

A grant to fund ZK applications on xDai and other Layer 2 sidechains. ZK proofs offer the ability for users to make private transactions. Why implement on xDai? Since xDai is a stable token, a primary use of the chain is peer-to-peer payments. Just as with cash, privacy should be an option when exchanging money or paying vendors for services. ZK protocols allow users to use xDai freely and anonymously.

**Distributions were made to the following projects**

* 30k Dai to Austin Griffith to implement ZK transactions in Burner Wallet
* 10k Dai to Poketto team to implement ZK transactions in Poketto Cash wallet
* 1.55mm POA \(~22k Dai\) to Tornado Cash team to deploy Tornado on xDai Chain
