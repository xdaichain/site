# Smart Contract Dashboard

## Chainbeat Dashboard on xDai

Blockchains are designed to receive and catalog a constant stream of data. Without the right analytic tools, data quickly becomes overwhelming and difficult to analyze. Dashboards are becoming an essential blockchain feature, and the xDai [ChainBeat](https://chainbeat.io/) integration makes it easy to gain valuable insights around token usage and smart contract interaction.

The ChainBeat interface is amazingly simple to use. Sign up, plugin a smart contract address, and then checkout the resulting insights. The dashboard allows you to look through and analyze many different metrics including transaction & token volume, events, & user insights like active and new users.  You can drill down into each of these metrics to get granular info, setup alerts, and export data in a csv format.

## **xDai example**

On xDai, the Safaru token is a local currency now circulating among Kenyan communities. Community members use Sarafu-based tokens for local trade and to purchase basic goods.   The ChainBlock dashboard shows basic token usage over the past week, including the number of transactions, new users, total holders and more.

## **Creating a dashboard**

1\) With the starter plan, you can create two for free. Once you’ve signed up, click Add Address, enter the Smart Contract address and Click **Submit**.

2\) Next, if the contract is deployed to multiple chains, select the network you would like to receive insights from and click **Confirm**. In this case, Sarafu is only deployed to the xDai chain, so there is no choice of networks to select.

3\) Your private dashboard will begin to populate. With xDai, it only takes a few minutes.

## **Creating a public report**

To create a custom report you can share, go the Report Studio. Here you can create different ****widgets to display with different types of data. The Chainbeat Report Studio tutorial walks you through the process here:  [https://chainbeat.io/reports/help](https://chainbeat.io/reports/help)  
  
Chainbeat makes it easy to monitor smart contracts and get useful information about usage.
