### Arbitrary Message Bridge Extensions for Users

Instructions for easy deployment were released for  the Ethereum &lt;-&gt; xDai Arbitrary Message Bridge. The guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating a bridgeable ERC20 \(or ERC677/829\) token. The deployment scripts create an equivalent ERC677 on xDai, along with all the necessary functionality so that existing tokens on Ethereum can be bridged and used on xDai. 

Use-cases for bridged tokens may include a DEX on xDai, or many other features that take advantage of low cost and high speed transactions.
