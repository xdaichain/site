### ✅ xDai + Elrond Partnership

xDai will partner with Elrond to architect their interoperability solution. The modified TokenBridge will be implemented to enable cross-chain communication between Elrond and Ethereum.

DeFi solutions continue to grow, and interoperability is needed to provide scalability. Excited to see what comes of this partnership!

## 👷♀ Dev Updates

### ✅ Connext Reddit entry \(Spacefold.io\) features xDai

In addition to our [entry for the Reddit Bakeoff](https://challenge.xdaichain.com/), [Connext ](https://connext.network/)entered with their spacefold.io demo, which demonstrates state channels connecting xDai to Rinkeby for cross-chain transfers. This is a second method of interoperability for xDai \(along with the TokenBridge\), allowing for interoperability without intermediaries.
