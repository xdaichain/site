## 📡 xDai Stable Coin Listed on Bitmax

The [xDai/USDT pair](https://bitmax.io/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai) has been listed on Bitmax. Now users can acquire xDai directly through the exchange without needing to bridge from Ethereum. This saves xDai users money on gas and provides a direct conduit to the xDai Chain. BitMax offers trading for both xDai/USDT and STAKE/USDT.

### ✅ APY View added to BlockScout POSDAO Staking DApp

The POSDAO staking APY is dynamic and varies from pool-to-pool based on the number of delegators, the number of blocks skipped by a validator, and rewards from bridge fees.  Current estimated APY varies from ~7.9% to almost 22% depending on the validator pool.

### ✅ OmniBridge: New Features Increase Decentralization

The latest OmniBridge release provides important new functionality for users bridging ERC20s between Ethereum and xDai. The biggest change is the new claiming feature, where users take control of claims when moving tokens from xDai to Ethereum. Other updates include:

* Set “unlimited” unlock for tokens, reducing the need to process the unlock transaction each time.
* Set an alternative RPC url in the Settings window
* **MOON and HNY tokens can now be transferred from xDai to Ethereum with the bridge**! As a result, [HNY tokens are now listed on Sushiswap](https://twitter.com/Honeyswap/status/1357494901911392257).
* More on the Claiming Process [available here](https://forum.poa.network/t/request-and-claim-to-transfer-assets-from-xdai-chain/4495).
