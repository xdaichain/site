## 🏛 Governance Updates

### Stakefish Proposal to join Validator Set 

After a good deal of discussion and merits of adding an additional professional node operator to xDai \(01Node also recently added\), the Stakefish proposal will likely pass. Currently the voting is 100% Yes with less than 24 hours remaining\). 

Stakefish will be onboarded as a new validator with plans to bring new resources and expertise to the chain. No funds will be sent from the ecosystem fund, instead an existing POA validator will be transferred to Stakefish.

### Funding Proposal for xDai Branding

As signaled by the community, 525K Stake was alloted from the Ecosystem fund to the Raidguild team to begin with their rebranding proposal. Next steps will involve a Sprint, Proposal, and Refinement over the course of the next several months.

### Matching SushiSwap Incentives Proposal 

A proposal to introduce matching incentives as LP rewards \(1M in Stake from xDai to match 1M in Sushi from Sushiswap\) was a highly debated proposal with many comments and more than 80 voters. The proposal was initiated from the Sushiswap side which resulted in some contingencies related to vote timing. Despite being an expedited proposal, there was a lot of conversation discussing the merits and drawbacks and a lot of engagement from the community. The final vote resulted in 66% in favor of the additional incentives.

* Proposal: [https://forum.poa.network/t/proposal-to-add-stake-incentives-matched-to-the-sushiswap-deployment-on-xdai/5821](https://forum.poa.network/t/proposal-to-add-stake-incentives-matched-to-the-sushiswap-deployment-on-xdai/5821)
