## ⛽ 1,000,000,000,000+ Gas Consumption Milestone

The xDai chain hit over 1 Trillion total gas consumed since network inception! This number has grown steadily over time starting with events like [EthDenver](../../use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/ethdenver.md) and the [Splunk Conference](../../use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/splunk-conference-non-crypto-conference.md) with massive recent spikes due to applications like [Dark Forest](../../project-spotlights/dark-forest.md) and [Circles UBI](../../project-spotlights/circles-ubi.md) leveraging xDai to support resource-intensive apps.

## 🙅♂ POSDAO Testing and Tutorials

We are continuing to test our protocol and create short videos for users as public POSDAO gets closer to launch.  See the [Staking Operations Section](../../../for-stakers/staking-protocol/staking-operations/) for tutorials on delegator staking, withdrawing, claiming and moving STAKE.

## 📜 Proposal to add STAKE as a DAI collateral type

All xDai users are essentially Dai users, as all xDai is bridged from Dai. The application to add STAKE as a Dai collateral type, giving the STAKE governance and security token additional supportive functionality within the ecosystem. The application below provides a succinct overview of xDai along with many resources for further exploration.
