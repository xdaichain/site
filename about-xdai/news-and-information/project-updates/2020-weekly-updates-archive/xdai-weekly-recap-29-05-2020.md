## 🏢 Development

### ✅ xDai POSDAO on OpenEthereum

As we move towards public POSDAO, xDai is already functioning in a PoS context written in Solidity.  [https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts](https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts). Starting from v3.0.0, the OpenEthereum client supports all POSDAO features [https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum). 3.0.0 has been released for several weeks, and POSDAO is functioning as expected, including random number generation, malicious reporting, and transactional consensus with the current validator set.
