Galleass is a fully decentralized, hand painted, age of sail, resource management game running on the xDai blockchain. Created by Austin Griffith \(Burner Wallet, DAOG, and many other DApps\), Galleass is a relaxing blockchain game which starts by purchasing a Dogger \(a ship, for .001 xDai!\), then using the ship to catch fish. Fish can be exchanged for copper, which can be used to purchase land as you start to build your civilization. 

The graphics are quite nice, and the game proceeds at a meandering pace as you build up your resources. Austin explains it best:
