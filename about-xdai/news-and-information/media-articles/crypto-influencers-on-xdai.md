## Dr. Gavin Wood

> We will introduce a **Substrate to** [**Parity-Ethereum-PoA**](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum) **bridge**, very similar to our existing [Parity Bridge](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridge) that sits at the heart of the [xDAI](https://xdai.io/) chain...

## Anthony Pompliano

> xDAI is a `MAGICAL` first experience for people. Ric showed it to me and I've used it multiple times with those unfamiliar with crypto. It leads to them wanting to learn more very quickly.

## Vitalik Buterin

> Burner Wallet \([website](https://xdai.io/), [explainer article](https://settle.finance/blog/what-is-the-burner-wallet-and-whats-xdai/)\) is an "insta-wallet" that's very easy to use: just load it up on your desktop or phone, and there you have it. It was used successfully at EthDenver to sell food from food trucks, and generally many people appreciate its convenience. Its main weaknesses are lower security and that one of its features, support for xDAI, is dependent on a permissioned chain.

Note: After xDai moved to POSDAO, the permissioned critique is less  valid
