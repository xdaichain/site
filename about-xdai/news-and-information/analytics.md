# Analytics

xDai is tightly integrated with [Dune Analytics](../../for-developers/developer-resources/dune-analytics.md), and we have created several dashboards to provide metrics and insights about xDai usage. Community members and project devs can also use these dashboards as a starting point to create and provide their own project-related metrics.

## Current Dashboards
