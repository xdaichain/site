{% endhint %}

Project owners anywhere in the world can easily publish an online profile and start accepting donations within minutes. Donors’ contributions go 100% directly to the project. 

Users can choose to donate using the Ethereum network or the xDai chain, and can donate with additional tokens as well. With xDai, users can stretch donations much further thanks to low transaction fees.  Just switch to xDai in the MetaMask network \(or with the integrated Torus wallet\) to donate xDai or other tokens you hold on the xDai chain.
