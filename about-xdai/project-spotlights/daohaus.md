# DAOHaus

DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\) are thriving on the blockchain. Unfortunately, high gas prices have created a situation where governance is very expensive. Proposal creation and voting is what allows DAOs to make decisions, choose directions and create rules for their organizations in a decentralized way. To alleviate these cost concerns, DAOHaus has created an instance on the xDai chain!

🏡 **Visit Daohaus, the no code platform for launching magic internet communities now at** [**https://daohaus.club/**](https://daohaus.club/)\*\*\*\*

🤑 You will also need some xDai - you can convert Dai to xDai using the bridge UI at [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/).  Connect your web3 wallet to Ethereum and select the amount of Dai to transfer. Once it is transferred, connect to the xDai network to interact with Daohaus.  

 🦊 Need help [setting up MetaMask & connecting to xDai](../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md)?
