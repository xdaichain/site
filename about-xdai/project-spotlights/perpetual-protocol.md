# Perpetual Protocol

## What it is

[Perp.fi](https://perp.fi/) is a trading platform for perpetual contracts. Trading costs ~ 0.0005 DAI per tx on xDai, allowing fees to be subsidized by Perpetual Protocol. 

Perpetual contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of a given asset by buying \(going long\) or selling \(going short\) perpetual futures contracts. Unlike typical futures, perpetuals do not expire. Instead, they automatically renew after a fixed period \(1 hour, in the case of Perpetual Protocol\).

Staking with the PERP token is also coming to the protocol. To learn more, see the Perpetual docs at [https://docs.perp.fi/](https://docs.perp.fi/)

## How it works

Setup and trading is easy and users can start in minutes. Withdrawals can be processed at any time. See the docs for more information. The community-created video below explains the basics.
