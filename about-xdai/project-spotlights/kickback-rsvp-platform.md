# Kickback RSVP Platform

The Kickback platform creates accountability for event attendees and helps organizers plan and organize event turnout. Anyone can create an event on the platform and set an xDai value for the RSVP.  The RSVP monies are pooled, and anyone who RSVP'd but didn't attend loses their share. The funds are then returned to participants, along with the additional xDai forfeited by any no shows. This can be kept or gifted to the event speakers or organizers as well.

Kickback is available on xDai at [https://xdai.kickback.events/](https://xdai.kickback.events/)

KickBack is also on the Ethereum Mainnet, but high gas fees made it untenable - guests were paying more in gas fees that the price to attend an event.  [Read more about the transition and details here](https://medium.com/wearekickback/kickback-x-the-three-experimental-new-features-bb75e1149022).
