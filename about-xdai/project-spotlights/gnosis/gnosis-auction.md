# Gnosis Auction

Gnosis Auction is live on Ethereum and xDai! It provides the ability for anyone to auction ERC20 tokens in a fair and transparent manner. Gnosis Auction uses Batch Auctions, which give users more control in the bidding process.

Use cases include token sales and collateral shortfall events. Users and projects can leverage xDai and save money on fees when conducting an auction.
