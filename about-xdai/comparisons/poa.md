# POA Network

## Differences between POA Network and xDai Chain

[POA Network](https://poa.network) is an R&D organization as well as a network, and the xDai stable chain is a chain created by the POA Network. Other POA projects include [BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com) and [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/) \(both recipients of Ecosystem Support from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/)\). 

The first iteration of the xDai chain was modeled after the POA Network chain but included some important advancements. xDai was created as the first stable chain, meaning payments and fees were all completely stable and predictable. It inherited the speed and low fees of POA, but allowed for many new kinds of use cases, creating rapid adoption in the community. 

In POSDAO phase 2, xDai will move to a permissionless chain, making it more decentralized & ideal as a stable payment platform.  ****

|  | **POA Chain** | **xDai Chain** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native Token** | POA - Volatile | xDai - Stable |
| **Validators** | Limited to US Notaries | Open: Known Worldwide Organizations - moving to decentralized community |
| **Bridge** | POA-to-ETH Bridge | ETH-to-xDai Bridge, AMB bridge for projects |
| **Consensus** | Proof of Autonomy \(POA\) | POSDAO Phase 1 \(delegated Proof of Stake\) |
| **Liquidity** | Limited with POA20 | Very High -  based on Dai liquidity |
| **Tooling** | Developed tools, specialized usage | Advanced & User-Friendly tools like Burner Wallet, Splunk  |
| **On-Chain Randomness** | Yes | Yes |
| **Blocktime & Fees** | 5 seconds, low \(volatile\) fees | 5 seconds, 500 tx for less than $.01 |
| **Use Cases** | Games, subsidized transactions, no-loss savings lotteries | DeFi, stable payments, community currencies, DAO- based projects  |

## Differences between POA token and STAKE token

The POA token is the native currency of the POA Core network. It is used to send transactions on the chain, and to pay fees for those transactions. Validators earn POA for each block that they seal. POA is a volatile token - the price changes based on market forces. This makes it challenging to use for payments as the value can change rapidly. In addition, POA can be bridged to the Ethereum mainnet and used as POA20.

STAKE is an entirely different kind of token - it is used to secure the underlying consensus of a chain. Validators and delegators use STAKE as collateral in a Proof-of-Stake consensus architecture. On the xDai chain, xDai is used for stable transactions \(similar to POA, but as a stablecoin\) and STAKE protects the underlying consensus \(honest validators earn rewards, misbehaving validators are banned\).

| **Type** | Volatile | Stable | Volatile |
| **Purpose** | Transactions, fees, medium of exchange | Transactions, fees, medium of exchange, P2P payments | Protect consensus |
| **Network** | POA Network | xDai Network | Initially xDai Network. Multi-chain capability in the future. |
| **Initial Supply** | 252,460,800 | Variable, bridged from Dai | 8,537,500 |
