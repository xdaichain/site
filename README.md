## xDai Stable Chain

The xDai chain is a stable payments EVM \(Ethereum Virtual Machine\) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; [xDai ](for-users/get-xdai-tokens/)is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [STAKE](for-stakers/stake-token/) is a governance token used to support the underlying [POSDAO Proof-of-Stake](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) consensus.

## **xDai Developers**

Development on xDai is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers. xDai is an EVM chain, and smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints)

Any contract that works on the Ethereum mainnet can be redeployed to the xDai chain. On the xDai chain, transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, xDai. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with xDai, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org/)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com/)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io/)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......

🛠 See [Developer Resources and Tools](for-developers/developer-resources/) to get up-and-running quickly.
