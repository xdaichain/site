## Pre-Staking on BitMax

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Pre-staking program has expired, but you can still stake through BitMax. BitMax staking using the EasyStaking engine to provide APR emissions. 💡[BitMax Staking ](https://ascendex.com/en/global-digital-asset-platform#/staking/investment-product-details/STAKE-S)

BitMax 3 month pre-staking provided an estimated 36.4% return on STAKE  though the StakeVault program.

StakeVault is a brand-new initiative offered by BitMax. It allows projects to refine staking designs and algorithms while public token holders participate in simulated staking. Participants earn real rewards and projects fine-tune their infrastructure through an incentivized platform.

## **How it Works**

Participants lock tokens in a simulated staking environment on BitMax. Rewards are distributed daily at **36.4% APR**. The program continues for 3 months, providing participants with the opportunity to earn STAKE rewards as the protocol prepares for public validation and staking. With pre-staking,  every 1000 STAKE placed in StakeVault equals 1 STAKE/day in rewards.

When open public staking starts, users may continue to use StakeVault or may choose to use the xDai user interface for staking and delegated staking.  [Rewards for public staking on xDai are described here.](../stake-token/stake-reward-mechanics/rewards-in-a-dual-token-environment.md)
