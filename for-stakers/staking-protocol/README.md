{% hint style="warning" %}
Public Staking is not here yet, but we are gathering documentation related to xDai staking processes. All pages in this section are currently under construction.
{% endhint %}

1. Tokens: You will need [STAKE tokens ](../stake-token/)for staking and xDai for any staking transactions \(such as placing, moving or withdrawing stake\) or other on-chain transactions.
2. [Become a Delegator](become-a-delegator.md)**.** Stake on current candidates and validators.
3. [Become a Candidate](become-a-candidate-validator.md)**:** Configure an xDai node and place the minimum required stake to become a candidate.
4. Learn more about [moving stake](staking-operations/move-stake.md), [withdrawing stake](staking-operations/withdraw-stake.md), [claiming stake](staking-operations/claim-stake.md), and [adding additional stake](staking-operations/add-stake.md).
5. [Read the glossary ](terminology/protocol-terms.md)for an overview of the protocol and explanation of terms and features.
